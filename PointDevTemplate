Purpose - Point Dev tasks are executed to check that critical shared infrastructure is working as expected, and that important repositories are maintained 

Assigning a Dev - Devs are assigned on a weekly basis and are randomly shuffled so that there is no one person responsible for back-to-back assignments  

Dev Calendar - Point Devs are assigned through Teams Calendar which should sync with your Outlook calendar so you can see when you are scheduled, and which teammates are scheduled throughout the month  

Expected Behavior - Daily checks 

Adding New Items or Tasks to the Checklist - This should be driven and facilitated by the current point dev. This is initiated once we have a new metric/check to be added to the current list
